A simple python script which is used to search for lost files on your computer.
If you intend to use it, simply choose the drive you think the file is in and the name of the file.

The libraries you need to install for the script in order to work are in "file_searcher_install.txt" [In CMD type "pip install -r file_searcher_install.txt"].
